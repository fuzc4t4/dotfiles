# Dotfiles

Dotfiles for i3 while keeping xfce4 installed.
Inspired by parrot and archlabs default dotfiles.
By default this script will setup your hostname as transient and randomize your mac address every reboot.

Only Arch, openSUSE Tumbleweed and Debian Testing are being supported as for now.

## To-Do:
- [x] Script to auto install dependencies based on diffenrent distros
- [ ] Support for more color schemes and a script to change them, currently only nord is available
- [ ] Script to change the font configured, currently iosevka is configured
- [ ] Add parameters to install.sh to make verbosity optional and integrate future color scheme and font selector scripts to it.
